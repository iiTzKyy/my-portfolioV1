<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was my portfolio website. Honestly, i pretty like this design. Because it looks simple. But, i have asked my friends to try the user experience of it, and my friend give me feedback that its too complicated for common people. There is more weakness of this portfolio. I use VueJs to build this page. Because of its capability to make it Single Page Application (SPA), the page become lack of SEO. I know that there is a way to solve the problem, but its the hard way to solve it.
<br>
<br>

So i decided to make new portfolio website, but using another way. Now i use NuxtJs, which are next level of framework build with VueJs.
